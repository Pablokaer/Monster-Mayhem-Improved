## About the Project

This project was developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a game inspired by **roguelikes**. The goal is simple but challenging: **survive as long as possible and eliminate as many monsters as you can**.

## Game Mechanics

Each time you defeat a monster, new enemies appear based on a random draw system. In the early turns, **1 to 4 monsters** may spawn. Around turn 15, this number increases significantly, and **5 to 9 monsters** can appear at once.

The only way to survive is to **take down as many enemies as possible in a single turn**, using your resources and positioning wisely.

### How to get more actions per turn?

* Your **melee attack** has a chance to grant you an extra action.
* When you kill a monster, it may **drop an item** that gives you **two additional actions**.

With strategy, smart positioning, and a bit of luck, it's possible to pull off massive eliminations and survive longer.

## Monster Spawn Style

Monsters spawn **from the edges of the screen** and gradually move toward the center. This creates the feeling of facing an **endless horde** that constantly advances, adding tension and urgency to each turn.
